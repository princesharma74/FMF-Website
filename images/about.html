                                is a giant in the field of Indian literature who
                                belonged to Odisha. He created a revolution in novel writing by
                                departing from the romantic idiom and writing on social realism. His
                                portrayal of the common man and his concerns predated those of Prem
                                Chand and Rabindra Nath Tagore, the other giants of Indian literature,
                                as noted in Prof Sisir Das’s work, ‘The History of Indian Literature’.
                                His writings had elements which apart from promoting secular attitudes,
                                helped bring about social changes, to which he also contributed directly
                                as the dewan of some of the princely states of Odisha, in British India.
                                Odisha is the first state in India to have been established on the basis
                                of its language, for which he laid the groundstone. He infact fought
                                against various odds to save the language from exstnction, and is hailed
                                as the father of Modern Odia literature. Fakir Mohan’s writing speaks to
                                us today with the same urgency and freshness as when he set down his
                                words with a quill pen over a century ago. Fakir Mohan Senapati can, in
                                the truest sense, be dubbed as the Renaissance man.</p>

                        <p class=" f-size ">Vyasa kavi Fakir Mohan Senapati (1843-1918) in whose name the foundation has been instituted belonged to Odisha. His life & works have been documented by Doordarshan Archives / Prasar Bharti, Govt. of India, in a DVD format.
                            <br> <br> The English translation of one of his major works / novel ‘Six Acres & Third’ has recently been brought out by Penguin. Fakir Mohan Senapati’s writings are more than 100 years old and yet have a strong contemporary
                            relevance. <br><br> Besides, Fakir Mohan Senapati also saved the Odiya language from extinction & gave the Odiyas their identity. He is hailed as the father of Modern Odiya literature & is a household name in Odisha. Language
                            is an integral part of culture & heritage but unfortunately the use of the mother tongue and the regional languages is dying out amongst the youth, not only in Odisha but in many states of India. The foundation believes that
                            in order to understand one’s roots / culture & heritage, it is necessary to understand one’s language / mother tongue. <br><br> The use of language in Odisha is in a very deplorable state. Statistics reveals that only 33% of
                            students use the language in their formal education . Besides, linked to the language issue is the economic issue. Infact many of the Economic policy practitioners in International financial institutions like the World bank
                            and the IMF have begun to look towards cultural factors as key variables explaining successful transition strategies. Language is Synchretic and is more than just words. So the language movement is from all aspects a viable
                            proposition. <br><br> Our mission is to protect preserve & promote the language with the help of academic as well as cultural initiatives (revival of certain traditional arts). It is proposed hereby that the Odisha initiative
                            be made into a flagship project and later extended pan Indian. Recently on the 4th of January, 2012 an event was organized, by our foundation at the Habitat Centre, to formally launch the foundation. A cultural program based
                            on his novel “six acres and a third was presented with an interface with classical Odissi dance and theatre. Among the artistes were Sharon Lowen, Kavita Dwibedi and the eminent thespian Tom Alter. This was highly acclaimed
                            by the dignitaries as well as the audience who were present in large numbers. Odisha incidentally is the first state to have been established on the basis of language.

                            <li>To project the fact that Odissi dance which is highly acclaimed globally is inextricably linked to Odissi music. Odissi dance sans its traditional music is a non grata. To carry forward this mission through Odissi dance.

                            <li>To take up the issue of child labour from a cultural perspective. Much has been voiced and aired on the topic of child labour but it has been reduced to just some laboured lamentation. It is time that we revisit the issue and
                                see it through the cultural lens. It would serve the twin objectives of having a cultural continuity along with economic regeneration with a difference. The idea should be not to condemn child labour as such and ban it
                                outright instead to be pragmatic enough to put it in the right perspective. What is proposed here is that children of artisans, weavers, potters and craftsmen can be encouraged to be engaged in the family business, learn
                                the traditional skills in the secure confines of their home & in due course carry forward and enhance these traditions over time.</li>

                            thought. <br><br> I consider myself extremely fortunate to have
                            <strong> Dr. Anjana Dev,</strong> my friend and colleague from Gargi College, associated with FMF right from its genesis. Her support and constructive encouragement, pleasant demeanor combined with a highly developed sense
                            of commitment makes her a rare person. Her meticulous way of putting together all the relevant material and editing the text is visible in the layout and content of the FMF souvenir that is being presented before you today.
                            At a personal level, apart from other things she has been a big moral support. <br><br> I wish to express my deep appreciation to<strong> Dr. Bulbul Dhar- James,</strong> for the precious time she has devoted on the publicity
                            of the inaugural event of FMF as well as all the editorial help for the Souvenir. Her enthusiasm is incredibly infectious and a motivating element for many. I would also like to acknowledge Bulbul’s contribution in disseminating
                            information on the relevance of Fakir Mohan’s work and the many a collaborative activities like Workshops, Lectures, Panel Discussions planned with FMF and Academic Community in the near future many. I would further like to
                            mention here, that the logo of ‘Manav Dharma’ has been designed by her daughter,<strong>
                                Malaika Dhar- James.</strong> It is designated as our event logo and we shall use it for all events of the foundation. Bulbul has contributed in many ways and I personally and FMF considers her an asset.
                            <br><br> It is the very proficient<strong> Ms.Borsha Paricha</strong> who has facilitated the venue for all our monthly meetings at the India Habitat Centre. The Seminar on ‘Save the Yamuna River’, an FMF and ROW collaborative
                            endeavour was also held in NFI, IHC. It would be quite in place to mention here that the first seed of the FMF was sown here in the Habitat Centre with the initial prompting and encouragement from the two sisters
                            <strong>Ms. Jhanjha Tripathy,</strong> Director Ministry of Railways and<strong>
                                Borsha Paricha.</strong> It is perhaps their motivation that has helped me to take the final plunge and take voluntary retirement from my job as an Associate Professor in Economics, Gargi College, Delhi University and go
                            ahead with the registration of the Fakir Mohan Foundation (FMF). Indeed I their value association very much. <br><br> I would like to put on record my appreciation and blessings for <strong>Anupam Mishra, </strong>for having
                            designed the FMF logo. His sensitivity and creativity is reflected beyond designing, in directorial (Films) ventures that he is engaged with. Thanks are also due to
                            <strong>Mr. Birendra Pani & Sarat Nayak</strong> for designing & making the portrait of Fakir Mohan Senapati. I thank<strong>Ms. Nivedita Giri
                                Pradhan,</strong> Lecturer, Delhi University, for taking on the responsibility of doing the event management with utmost sincerity. I as Managing Trustee of Fakir Mohan Foundation consider myself highly fortunate to have
                            succeeded in garnering support from various quarters.
                            <br><br> That Fakir Mohan Senapati has pioneered literary creations in India on social realism is undisputed but what is most important is for us is to note is the contemporary relevance of the genre of his work from poems,
                            essays, novels, short stories, to autobiography. His writings echo the voice of the masses, the marginalized, disadvantages including women and girls. <br><br> We are highly grateful to the then Director General Doordarshan
                            <strong> Dr. S.Y.
                                Quraishi,</strong> presently the Chief Election Commissioner, who realized the value of the film project on Fakir Mohan Senapati since he is also a man of letters himself. Dr. Quraishi helped
                            with the sponsorship from Doordarshan for the film ‘Anvesan’ and hence the life and works of Fakir Mohan Senapati could be documented for posterity and for all the world to view the remarkable contribution made by this man
                            called Fakir Mohan. Incidentally Dr. Quraishi refers to Fakir Mohan Senapati as the ‘Ghalib’ of Odisha. <br><br> I thank that all who have contributed their bit in helping to make the event a grand success, Fakir Mohan Foundation
                            solicits their good wishes in carrying forward its mission. <br></p>
