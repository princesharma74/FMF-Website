For this FMF has designed a module that has elements of humanism which are interfaced with literature and language of the great writers/thinkers of India.  Humanism, it goes without saying, encompasses environmental consciousness, gender sensitization with special emphasis on gender equality, love for one’s heritage and realization about one’s roots/identity.
