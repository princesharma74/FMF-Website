                                <p class="f-size">FMF intends to take up the issue of child labour from a cultural perspective. Much has been voiced and aired on the topic of child labour but it has been reduced to just some laboured lamentation. It is time that we revisit
                                    the issue and see it through the cultural lens. It would serve the twin objectives of having a cultural continuity along with economic regeneration with a difference. The idea should be not to condemn child labour as
                                    such and ban it outright instead to be pragmatic enough to put it in the right perspective. What is proposed here is that children of artisans, weavers, potters and craftsmen can be encouraged to be engaged in the family
                                    business, learn the traditional skills in the secure confines of their home &amp; in due course carry forward and enhance these traditions over time.</p>
