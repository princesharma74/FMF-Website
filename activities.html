                                    <li>Fakir Mohan Foundation, New Delhi has <strong>launched a workshop program</strong> intended for the youth pan Odisha/ India titled ‘Back to Basics’ – a program for holistic development of the youth equipping them through soft skills for nation building. <strong>Workshop module</strong> design is in place - <strong>the unique element in the module is the interface of socio-economic concerns with language and literature</strong>. For this FMF has designed a module that has elements of humanism which are interfaced with literature and language of the great writers/thinkers of India.  Humanism, it goes without saying, encompasses environmental consciousness, gender sensitization with special emphasis on gender equality, love for one’s heritage and realization about one’s roots/identity. 
                                        We wish to carry out our agenda pan India. As a flagship movement we have already carried it out successfully in Odisha.
